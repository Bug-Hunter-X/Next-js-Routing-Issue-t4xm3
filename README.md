# Next.js Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Next.js applications related to routing. Links are not working as expected, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Description

A Next.js application with a home page (`pages/index.js`) and an about page (`pages/about.js`) is not routing correctly. The link to the about page from the home page does not navigate to the about page. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Click on the "Go to About" link. Observe that routing doesn't work as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the Next.js routing configuration is correct. This is demonstrated in the `bugSolution.js` file. For this particular example, the solution is to double-check there are no typos in the `href` attribute value within the `Link` component.
